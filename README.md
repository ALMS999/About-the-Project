# About the Project
The Campus Life Perspectives project is a collaboration with [DTU Campus Service](https://www.dtu.dk/om-dtu/organisation/administration/campus_service), [ERIK Architects](https://www.erik.dk/), [The Techno-Anthropology Lab](https://www.tantlab.aau.dk/) as well as [Polyteknisk Forening](https://www.pf.dk/) - and is part of [our](link) thesis project in Techno-Anthropology at Aalborg University Copenhagen. The project builds on an app developed in the [Urban Belonging Project](https://urbanbelonging.com/en) and aims to test it as a new, more participatory and data driven way of evaluating buildings and urban areas - in this case Lyngby Campus. By participating, you get a chance to voice your opinions and share experiences on life at Lyngby Campus - and hopefully help make campus a better place. The data collection part of the project will run during September, and any insights produced will be made available to our project partners. It doesnâ€™t matter if you're just starting at university, are about to finish or if you are just visiting for a the semester - your insights are valuable to us and the [Campus Renewal Project!](https://campusudvikling.dtu.dk/)
